For this project a OLS regression model was created in order to predict the amount of purchases an individual would make based on their 
demographics and other characteristics. OLS was chosen because interpretability and understanding was favored over possibly more accurate 
models. Certain features had to be engineered from the original dataset and the marginal effects that key predictors had on the dependent
variable was analyzed. The R code can be found in the .Rmd file and a PDF of the final project can be found in the .PDF file.
