This project involves comparing the results of a linear regression model with a bayesian regression model (constructed using MCMC) to 
determine how the models differ and their benefits. Results are bootstrapped to check for robustness. We also do some variable 
analysis on stocks and bond yields in order to determine how correlated they are with recessions.
