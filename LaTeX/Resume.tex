{\bf Labor Market Efficiency in Major League Baseball}\\
Analyzed the Major League Baseball labor markets to determine if they are still inefficient as well as determine which player statistics are currently being overvalued or undervalued. Used refined regression models, VAR models, Granger-Causality tests, IRFs, and other Econometric techniques  to answers different questions regarding player salary, valued statistics, and payroll effects. 

{\bf Black Friday Sales Analysis}\\
 Used a Black Friday sales data set provided by Kaggle in order to predict the amount a person would purchase based on their demographic characteristics. Created a regression model and provided some benchmarks of how well it predicted. Also performed a descriptive analysis of variables, performed model tests for robustness, and variable transformations to mitigate modeling issues. 

{\bf UCLA MAE Lab}\\
 Helped create a script for Python that parses through different news websites to collect the count of specific words while looking at related business articles. These articles are then used to perform a sentiment analysis on current economic conditions. Also worked on creating a script that uses a Twitter API to perform similar analysis.
