Each script demonstrates how to fit a specific machine learning model to a dataset using SciKit Learn and Tensorflow/Keras. The Extra 
folder contains util files that define functions which are later imported in the FNN and SVM scripts. The Extra folder also contains the script to download the data from a repository. 

FNN- Fits a feed forward neural network to a set of images and trains the model to predict what number the image is displaying. Model is created using Tensorflow and Keras. 

SVM- Fits a Support Vector Machine to a dataset and created
